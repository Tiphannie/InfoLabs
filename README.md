This repository has over 27 projects that i have done showcasing my talent in different areas from creating a scrabblecheater, solving abstract data type problems,
working on the reverse polish notation to tackling the famous eight queens puzzle. All projects were written in Java to give me a solid/strong foundation in the Java programming language.
